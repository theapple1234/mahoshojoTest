        description: "The Mother always insisted that temporal powers were simply \"impossible\". A bold-faced lie. They experimented with them once and found they were very possible, but canned the whole experiment and sealed them away, worried what sort of Pandora's Box they were opening. Once in your life, this spell will allow you to set a \"save point\". At any point in the next 5 years, you can revert everything back to that save point at will. This destroys the save point permanently. If you die, or if the 5 years passes on its own, you'll flash back to the point automatically."

        description: "That Nero Inc shit has got limits. Limits on the sorts of feelings you can evoke, the experiences you can create. But with this, if you've got a Verse, you don't have any more limits. You can create emotions more intense than any that are possible within the surface verse. Sure, you can create pleasure powerful enough to fry the mind... or you can create a hellscape of agony so unspeakable it will fundamentally break the psyches of even the most legendary and stalwart of souls. Imagine getting one of those Daughters into a hell like that..."

        description: "Granting powers through Theosis is easy to do, but hard as fuck to undo. They once experimented with ways to strip a mage of their powers, but the queen bitch shut it down, fearing it might lead to 'authoritarianism', the fuckin' hypocrite. We've got a hack job of our that come pretty close, though. Once you've got a mage down for the count, really knocked out cold, you can perform a ritual that strips their every power — permanently. You even get some of their powers at random after, though they only stick around temporarily."

        description: "The sword of the executioner Angels up in the Garden of Eden back when capital punishment was still a thing. It slices through mages as easy as it would mundanes — seriously, lobbing off limbs and splitting through torsos more easily than any other weapons in existence. However, they are so powerful that it's painful just to holds its handle. They are also enchanted to feel extremely heavy and exhausting to wield, and even the strongest mages will find them slow and unwieldy in combat, so they're best used to finish off weakened foes."
